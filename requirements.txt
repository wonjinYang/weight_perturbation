# This file lists the dependencies required to install and run the weight_perturbation library.
# It includes core libraries for PyTorch-based models, optimal transport computations,
# numerical operations, plotting, and configuration handling.
# Versions are pinned to ensure reproducibility and compatibility.
# Install using: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core deep learning framework
torch>=2.0.0  # PyTorch for neural networks and tensor operations

# Optimal transport library (used in losses.py for SamplesLoss)
geomloss>=0.2.6  # For Sinkhorn divergences and Wasserstein distances

# Numerical computing library
numpy>=1.24.0  # For array manipulations and mathematical operations

# Plotting library (used in utils.py for visualizations)
matplotlib>=3.8.0  # For creating distribution plots and figures

# YAML parsing for configuration files (used in utils.py)
pyyaml>=6.0.1  # For loading hyperparameters from YAML configs

# Optional: For type hinting and static analysis (not required at runtime)
typing-extensions>=4.5.0  # For advanced type hints in Python 3.8+

# Development dependencies (not required for core library usage, but for tests and examples)
# pytest>=7.2.0  # For running unit tests (in tests/ directory)
# setuptools>=65.0.0  # For packaging and distribution (in setup.py)
# wheel>=0.38.0  # For building wheel packages

# Note: If using CUDA, ensure torch is installed with CUDA support (e.g., torch==2.0.0+cu117).
# For specific hardware, refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
# This file can be extended with additional dependencies as needed for extensions or custom use cases.
